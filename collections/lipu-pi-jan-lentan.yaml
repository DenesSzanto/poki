# One might argue this goes against the principle that authors
# shouldn't have their own collections, as their works may instead
# be browsed through author search. I'd argue in this case creating
# a collection is warranted, because it's specifically those articles
# by jan Lentan which are stored in one list at lipu sona pona,
# and allows us to list excluded items.
