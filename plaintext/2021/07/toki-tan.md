<!-- "toki tan", a creation story in toki pona (inspired by evolution) + a suggestion for month names in the toki pona lunisolar calendar 

toki!! sorry for the really nasa title. i promise itll make sense by the end.

i really love the [toki pona lunisolar](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/dr378j/lunisolar_calendar_for_toki_pona_done/) calendar created by u/pisceyo . (if you would like to see a working rendition of that calendar, [o lukin e ni](https://nilakayas.neocities.org/karya/kalender.html) tan u/just-a-melon ). one feature of the lunisolar calendar is that its months (or moons, as i will use commonly thruout this post) lack names. here is my sugestion for a potential month naming system.

why might month names benefit the lunisolar calendar?

while tying the moon names to local seasons can be good for personal or local use, it is prone to issues in an online setting. all over the world, the local seasons vary alot. in the southern hemisphere, many places have 4 seasons but in an opposite arrangement to temperate northern hemisphere countries. some places have more than 4 seasons. some places only have 2 seasons. also, if you have 6 or 8 months of one season, thats going to be hard to talk about in a language where the numbers bigger than 2 are deliberately difficult to say.

it would be simpler if the moons of the toki pona lunisolar calendar had names that everyone could use, no matter their local seasons. these names would have to be based on something other than seasons? in many cultures, months are named after mythological figures.

i have always been struck by how poetically beautiful the big bang and the evolution of life on earth is. to me, its like a creation myth. so i wrote a creation story in toki pona inspired by evolution. it is called toki tan and it is in the form of poetry. it is at the end of this post.

so what would be the month names?

i picked toki pona words as the month names. this means that this naming system requires neither new words, nor loan words to operate. the month names are:

mun Wan, mun Kon, mun Seli, mun Ma, mun Telo, mun Mama, mun Kasi, mun Pipi, mun Kala, mun Akesi, mun Waso, mun Soweli.

the intercalary month is still called "mun Namako". moon names would be capitalized in writing to disambiguate them from normal toki pona words, and because they are technically acting as proper names.

the names are symbolic of important moments for the evolution of life on earth, arranged roughly in chronological order (i make no claims of their exactness. the precise timing of evolution is complicated to measure, and so this is a useful approximation for the sake of convenience and poetry, and not a definitive statement of truth. if it suddenly turned out that fish had actually evolved before arthropods, i dont think it'd really be necessary to change the month names to reflect that)

the brief reasoning for these names:

* mun Wan - the inital state of the universe, when everything was one
* mun Kon - the time after the big bang, when the universe was all gasses/plasma (kon) like hydrogen and helium
* mun Seli - referring to the beginning of star formation. i avoided calling it mun Mun or mun Suno because that could cause miscommunication fairly easily.
* mun Ma - referring to the formation of our planet earth
* mun Telo - referring to formation of liquid water on earth, & to the cooling of earth
* mun Mama - referring to LUCA, the ancestor every living thing on earth shares, and within toki tan to prokaryotes more broadly
* mun Kasi - origin of plants
* mun Pipi - origin of arthropods
* mun Kala - origin of fish
* mun Akesi - origin of land tetrapods, which started out as reptile-like animals before splitting into diapsids and synapsids.
* mun Waso - evolution of avian dinosaurs ("birds")
* mun Soweli - evolution of mammals (including humans)
* mun Namako - haha spicy moon

EDIT: upon suggestion from a few people (including u/just-a-melon ), i would also recommend that if you want to be specific/unambiguous about the fact that you're talking about the moon names presented in this system, you could also use nanpa. so you would say "mun nanpa wan, mun nanpa kon, mun nanpa seli, etc.". this is similar to how lipu tenpo numbers their issues.

so thats my suggestion for moon names. now, here is the toki tan poem. it is a piece that i wrote to stand on its own merit, but to support/provide additional flavor to this month-naming system as well. it also makes use of a few of the proverbs given in pu. i'm happy about this poem and i hope people like it. translation forthcoming in comments

for the record: it is currently mun Telo of sike 20 (2021-07-12). the month just started a few days ago.
